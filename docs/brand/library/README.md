# grid-masonry-dynamic-images
A masonry grid layout that populates images by pulling them from a local folder

Powered by jQuery, and must run on localhost or a server to work correctly.

Be sure to remove restrictions on image permissions, set to at least "read only"

For a more advanced masonry grid that pulls in multiple resolution images, check out https://github.com/labelle/grid-masonry-multires-images/blob/master/README.md
